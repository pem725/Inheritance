# Inheritance

A little bit of detail for how I want *my share* of our collective estate to be divided when I am no longer...

## Some answers before you ask
1.  Yes, I shall pass (as all good and bad in life).
2.  Yes, I want my family to inherit my shit.
3.  No, I don't want to spoil anyone (except my wife).

## Some principles
1.  Help but don't hinder
2.  Think long-term not short-term
3.  Show love and care
4.  No favorites
5.  Equitable NOT Equal
